    <h1><u>My Travels</u></h1>
    <p>My family and I have visited six countries so far and have gone to Sikkim as a fun trip. All the places had their own fun. </p>

    <h2><u>Singapore</u></h2>
    <p>We visited Singapore in 2013 in the month of March. We saw many places there like the Lego museum, Helix bridge, Santosa Island, Universal Studio, Marina Bay Sand Hotel and Garden By The Bay. They were amazing. One of the best things was the Lego
        museum. There were people, cars, and other various things made out of Lego blocks. It was a completely new experience. </p><br><br><br>
